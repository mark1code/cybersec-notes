LEGALITIES & ETHICS

Computer Misuse Act 1990
- Makes it an offence to access any computer to which you do not have an authorised right to use
- Has provisions that state that the attempt does not need to have a specific target - as such, running a port scanner in an attempt to find insecure computers is an illegal act
3 Criminal offenses:
1 - Unauthorised access to computer material
2 - Unauthorised access with intent to commit of facilitate commission of other offences
3 - Unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing operation of computer
3ZA - Unauthorised acts causing, or creating risk of serious damage
3A - Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in another computer misuse act offence

Computer Misuse Act 1998
- Unauthorised acts causing, or creating risk of serious damage
- Territorial scope of computer misuse
- Serious crime Prevention Orders

Information Assurance vs Information Security
IA
The practice of assuring information, managing risks related to the use, processing, storage and transmision of information.
IS
A subcategory of IA, InfoSec is the practice of defending information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.

CIA : Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Ensuring information is not made available to unauthorised entities
- Protecting the accuracy and compleness of assests
- Property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised entity

Cryptographer = Defence / Cryptanalyst = Offense

CyBOK - Cyber Security Body of Knowledge
	A comprehensive Body of Knowledge to inform and underpin education and professional trianing for the cyber security sector

People, Process, Technology
- Seen as a foundation ofa successful IT system

Defence in depth

Layered approach to defences
	Harder to gain access
	Easier to detect issues
Zero trust
	Requires strict identity verification for every person and device whether inside or outside fo the network

Complexity makes it hard to attack and manage.
Security is as strong as the weakest link.

Security boundaries
Traditional security boundaries used to follow physical boundaries where all assets were in one location surrounded by physical protection. Modern organisations have blurred boundaries: cloud computing, home/mobile workers, shared platforms, outsourced services, BYOS, wireless networks.

Defence through diversification

User products from different manufacturers
Use different versions of products throughout network
	If all network components are the same, an attacker could breach them alll
Defence through diversificaiton applies to physical and logical design
	Use different encryption throught network
	Use different browsers for interal/external access
	Use different IP addresses for subnets (NAT between subnets)

Comparmentalise network services and access

Different physical servers for different roles: DNS, DHCP, Databases
Restrict access to zones

DMZ : De-Militarised Zone
	An area of the network that is neither as secure as the internal network, nor as insecure as the public internet
Contains the hosts that are most vulnerable to attack such as: e-mail, Web, DNS
Limited connectivity to selected internal hosts
Isolated by firewalls either side

Redundant design
Ensure you don't have a single-point-of-failure
	Networks should have redundancy built in
	Redundant systems replace live systems during incidents
	High availability: when one service goes down, there is a built in system to compensate
E.g: Power supplies, Serveres, Routers, Switches, Storage, Proxies, Buildings, Firewalls, Memory

Separation of duties
Primary reason is to prevent fraud and errors
	Identify all tasks in a process
	Identity milestone tasks
	Identify users capable of executing tasks

Concepts: Least privilege, Need to know, Comparamentalisation of data

Zero trust principles: Verify, Least privilege, Continous monitoring and validation, Prevent lateral movement

Frameworks and Guideance

No two orgs are alike; implementing security needs to be tailored to each business.
Some existing frameworks: ISO 27000 - Set of 15+ comprehensive docs relating to infosec, ITILv3, NIST standards, NCSC guidance
Some frameworks are mandatory if orgs want to perform certain functions: Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)

GDPR replaced Data Protection Act 1998.

STRIDE : Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privilege

Data Management is a process which involves a broad range of activities including administrative and technical aspects of handling data.

Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privilege

Vulnerabilities and Exploits:

Zero Day Vulnerability - a recently discovered vulnerability that is not yet publicly known. When they become known, reusuable commodity attacks can be devloped.

An exploit is the act of taking advantage of a vulnerability.
