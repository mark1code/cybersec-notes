Network Interfaces
End User Device (EUD) needs a Network Interface Card (NIC)
The NICs have an identifier known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address
(6 pairs of hexadecimal values, also known as physical address)

EUD connects to LAN:
	- Cable from the NIC to a switch
	- Wireless from the NIC to a Wireless Access Point (WAP)
Home devices (routers) often have all these in one package

Switches
	- Read the destination MAC
	- Compares the destination to switch lookup table
	- Forward the frame to the port address
	- Else forward to all
	- For LANs
Routers 
	- Connects two or more networks to create an Internetwork
	- Routers determine the destination networj by processing network address information in the data packet header
	- Routers use network maps (routing tables) to determine the best route to send data
	- Routers forward data packets to the interace which is connected to the determined route (forwarding)
	- Use their own protools for exchanging route availability info: RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP
	- For WANs
Internet : Network of networks
Internet Exchange Point (IXP)

IP address tells you: address where it's from and address 

Personal Area Network (PAN) : Very small area network, 1.5cm - 3m. E.g. USB, Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, etc

Packet switching:
	Data to be delivered is broken into indiviudal packets
		Addressing information in header
	Packets may not follow same path
	Network may be resistant to change and damage

Layered network models

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model: 7 layers
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-link, Physical
A Application specific, P formatting and encryption, S connections between apps, T host-to-host data transfer, N routing and forwarding, D frames data for network, P sends and receives bits on network media 

TCP/IP: 4 layers
Application, Transport, Internet, Link
Example: A HTTP, T TCP, I IP, L Ethernet
