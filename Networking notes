Network Interfaces
End User Device (EUD) needs a Network Interface Card (NIC)
The NICs have an identifier known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address
(6 pairs of hexadecimal values, also known as physical address)

EUD connects to LAN:
	- Cable from the NIC to a switch
	- Wireless from the NIC to a Wireless Access Point (WAP)
Home devices (routers) often have all these in one package

Switches
	- Read the destination MAC
	- Compares the destination to switch lookup table
	- Forward the frame to the port address
	- Else forward to all
	- For LANs
Routers 
	- Connects two or more networks to create an Internetwork
	- Routers determine the destination networj by processing network address information in the data packet header
	- Routers use network maps (routing tables) to determine the best route to send data
	- Routers forward data packets to the interace which is connected to the determined route (forwarding)
	- Use their own protools for exchanging route availability info: RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP
	- For WANs
Internet : Network of networks
Internet Exchange Point (IXP)

IP address tells you: address where it's from and address 

Personal Area Network (PAN) : Very small area network, 1.5cm - 3m. E.g. USB, Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, etc

Packet switching:
	Data to be delivered is broken into indiviudal packets
		Addressing information in header
	Packets may not follow same path
	Network may be resistant to change and damage

Layered network models

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model: 7 layers
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-link, Physical
A Application specific, P formatting and encryption, S connections between apps, T host-to-host data transfer, N routing and forwarding, D frames data for network, P sends and receives bits on network media 

TCP/IP: 4 layers
Application, Transport, Internet, Link
Example: A HTTP, T TCP, I IP, L Ethernet

Ethernet
Most popular LAN implementation:
	Data transmitted in frames
	Classed as a broadcast technology
Ethernet variants (defined in IEEE standards): 10Base5, 1000BaseT, 1000BaseSX, 10000BaseT

Network Layer Protocols

Accept requests from the Transport layer
Pass requests to the Data Link layer
Responsible for end-to-end data delivery
Responsible for logical addressing of data packets

Internet Protocol (IP)

Protocols that relate to this later include:
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

IP is responsible for end-to-end packet delivery:
	Provides logical addressing
	Non-reliable
	Loss of data
	Data corruption
	Used for routing data across networks
Used to identify a device within a network
	A portion of the address identifies the network
	The remaining portion identifies the host
Addresses are binary patterns
	Written as dotten decimal notation if using IPv4
	Written as hexadecimal notation if using IPv6
32 bit binary address

Subnet mask identifies which part of the IP address is the network part and the host/device part.
1 in mask = network portion of ip address
0 in mask = host portion of ip address


Broadcast address = device id = host id

Private address ranges for IPv4
Used since private networks don't have to be unique

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
The ARP is the standard method for finding a host's hardware address when only its network layer address is known.
It is not IP-only or Ethernet-only; it can be used to resolve many different network-layer protocol addresses to hardware addresses

Network Address Translation (NAT)
Router has two interfaces
	One is assigned a Public IP address (external)
	One is assigned a Private IP address (internal)
Nat translates between internal and external IP addresses
Process:
1. Client sends packet to router
2. Router maps internal IP address (iAddr) and internal port number (iPort) to an external IP address (eAddr) and external port number (ePort) and records these in a NAT table
3. Data is sent across Internet with eAddr & ePort values
4. Destination services respond back to eAddr & ePort
5. Router checks NAT table for values and replaces eAddr & ePort with iAddr & iPort and forwards to specificed device

IPv4 Limitations
Public IP address exhaustion
	IANA handed out the last IPv4 pools to RIR in Feb 2011
	ARIN handed out last block in Sept 2015
The original method of allocating addresses was inefficient
	Methods were introduced to prolong the life of IPV4
		CIDR & Route aggregation
		NAT (broke end to end connectivity)
IPv6 will be the long term solution

IPv6 originally defined in RFC 1773, then RFC 2460, now RFC 8200
128-bit addresses written in eight gorups of four hexadecimal digits
Each group represents 16 bits

Leading zeroes may be omitted: 0db8:0000:0000:0070 -> db8:0:0:70
A single group of consecutive zeroes can be replaced with a double colon:
85a3:0000:0000:8a2e -> 85a3::8a2e
You can only have one double colon

Types of IPv6 address
Global unicast (2000::/3) for Internet communications
Link-local (fe80) for communications within the same LAN/Segment/Subnet
Unique local (fc00) similar to private IP addresses
IPv6 does not use a broadcast address instead it uses multicast groups: ff00::/8

Allocating IPv6 addresses
IPv6 addresses can be allocated statically or dynamically
	StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) is one way of allocating
	SLAAC does nto need any server or relay because there is no state to maintain (RFC 2462)
Routers within a network advertise their IPv6 network prefix that identifies the subnet(s)
Hosts generate an interface identifier (the host portion) that uniquely identifeis an interface on a subnet
	Can use MAC address (EUI-64)
	Can be randomly generated (RFC 4941)
An address is formed by combining the two: Network prefix + interface identifier

Routers
Have multiple network interfaces
	Move IP datagrams from one interface to another
consult a routing table to make decisions
Two-part process
	Routing: Deciding the correct path to the destination
	Forwarding: Moving packets to the correct interface
May perform other functions
	Network Address Translation (NAT)
	Firewall

A routing table stores entries which are use for datagram forwarding:
Routing table entries consist of the following:
	Network ID
	Next hop
	May contain Metrics
	Routing protocols allow routers to create routing tables

Dynamic routing protocols
Routers advertise networks they know about
	Allows routers to build a map of the network
Three main classes of routing protocol: Distance vector, link-state, hybrid
Interior and Exterior Gateway Protocols

Distance vector routing (not really a good protocol):
Distance is the cost of reachign a destination, usually based onthe number of hosts the path pases through, or the total of all the administrative metrics assigned to the links in the path
Vector is the interface that traffic will be forwarded outr in order to reach a given destination.

Link-State routing:
Protocols:
- Require each router to maintain at least a partial map of the network
- Know whetehr a link is up or down, how fast it is and calculate an overall cost to get there
	- When a network link chagnes state (up to down, or vice versa), a notification, called a link state advertisement (LSA) is flooded throughout the network
		All routers note the change, and recompute their routes accordingly
- Will take a path which ahs more hops, but uses a faster medium instead of a path using a slower medium with fewer hops


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
DHCP provides automatic configuration of IP addressing
	Requires a DHCP serever
	Manages IP addresses and mask allocation from a pool of addresses
		Other configuration options availabile (DNS, addresses, DGW address, WINS addresses)
Client
	Configured to use dynamic addressing
	Leased the configuration for given period of time

Client-side DHCP
DHCP configues other aspects of IP addressing:
	Default Gateway address
	DNS Server addresses
	WINS server address
	To view IP information type ipconfig /all
	Configuration is leased for a given period
		Renewed at 50% of lease period
		IP configuration can be released
		IP address placed back into usable pool
DHCP function - IPv6
DHCP and DHCPv6 are known as stateful protocols because they maintain tables within dedicated servers.
DHCPv6 uses UDP ports
	Servers listen on UDP port 547
	Clients listen on UDP port 546
Messages
	DORA - replaced with new messages (SARR)
	SOLICIT (1), ADVERTISE (2), REQUEST (3), REPLY (7)

Internet control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Defined in RFC 792
Used for control and information messages
Reporting errors and diagnostic purposes
Multiple message types available
Header contains:
	Type: define type of packet
	Code: further specifies the ICMP type
	Checksum: Used to error-check the ICMP header and data
	The rest: varying data dependant on code and type

Ping tests network connectivity, 4 packets
Traceroute displays routers used to a given destination, 3 packets

DNS resolution = DNS name -> IP address
Two types of DNS query: 

DNS forward lookup - Known DNS name, unknown IP address
[A] records resolve a name to an IP address

DNS reverse lookup - Known IP address, unknwon DNS name
[AAAA] records

DNS Root servers
	Store copies of the root zone database
	Maps Top Level Level Domain names (TLDs) to authoritative DNS servers
	13 named Root server authorities
	More than 13 physical servers - accessed by anycast
	Root Server address cached by DNS servers

Caching DNS servers
Most basic type of DNS server
	Contains no authoritative zone databases
	Performs recursive queries on behalf of clinets
	Queries global DNS during recursive query
Requires IP addresses of Root Servers
	Root Hints file
Answer to query is
	Cached on the server
	Passed to the client

Authoritative DNS servers
Host DNS zone databses
Can make authoritative answers to DNS queries
Zone database has a specific structure
Used by both Windows servers and Unix servers

Domain Names
A domain name is a text string that can be mapped to an IP address
domain names form the basis of the DNS
	DNS is used to obtain the IP address of a device from its given domain name
Internet Domains Names must be registered
	Registration can be via a domain registrar
Domain Names must be unique on the Internet
domain Name Records are stored in zone files on name servers

The Hosts file
Text file containing hostname to IP address mappings
	Contents loaded inot the DNS cache at system startup or if changes to the file are made
Windows C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc
Default entry is the loopback address
Can be used as a security measure, but can also be poisoned

DNS cache contains previous lookups
Entries re-used to reduce load on DNS servers
	Caches positive and negative responses
	Cached data is timed out
		Entries specifiy their own TTL
Use ipconfig /displaydns to show cache contents
ipconfig /flushdns to empty cache


Layer 4 and 5 technologies

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Provides end-to-end data transfer between applications
	Uses port numbers
	No flow control
	No connection setup
	No lost data retransmission
Useful in some situations
	Single data packets
	Voice over IP (VOIP)
Defined in RFC 768

UDP header structure
Source port
	Identifies sending port using 16 bits - optional
Destination port
	Identiies destination port using 16 bits - mandatory
Length
	Length of entire datagram in bytes - mandatory
Checksum
	16 bit checksum error-checking header and data - mandatory

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
Provides end-to-end data transfer between applications
Uses port numbers
TCP has flow control
	Arranges data into byte stream
Connection-oriented
Acknowledges data receipt
Used if sending multiple packets e.g web pages or .mp3 files
Defined in RFC 793

TCP header structure
Complex header
Includes: source/destination port, sequence number, acknowledgement number, offset, res, checksum, flag, window, urgent pointer, options
32 bit options fields can be used if needed
16 bit source/destination ports identify endpoints of the TCP connection


3-Way handshake
Begins every TCP conversation
SYN packet:
	Has the SYN flag set, contains sender's Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
SYN/ACK packet:
	Has SYN & ACK flags set
	Contains receivers ISN
	Acknowledgement number = sender's ISN + 1
ACK packet
	Has ACK flag set
	Sequence number = ISN + 1
	Acknowledgement number = receiver's ISN + 1k

Ports and sockets
A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on a network
A socket is bound to a port number so that TCP/UDP can identify the program that data is destined for
A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number -e.g 87.16.4.96:63584
Every TCP or UDP session can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints
Multiple sessions can be established between host and server

Ports and port numbers
There are 2^16 TCP & 2^16 UDP ports
	Port numbers can be registered wiht IANA
Ports 0 to 1023 - System ports / well-known range
Ports 1024 to 49151 - User ports
Ports 49152 to 65535 - Dynamic ports

Example ports and services
Web browsing protocols and corresponding port numbers
HTTP uses port 80 on the web server b default
	Data sent via HTTP is not encrypted
HTTPS uses port 443 on the web servers by default
	Data sent by HTTPS is encrypted

An email protocol and corresponding port number
POP3 uses port 110 on the email server by default, not encrypted
POP3S usese port 995 on the emial server by default, encrypted

Services: web server, email server
Ports: 80, 110
Internet Protocol: IP Address
Network card: Data arrives and leaves device

Client ports
Client applications allocated dynamic port numberse when launched
	IANA dynamic ports 49152-65535
Ports are ephemeral
	Temporary allocation
	When connection closed, port mapping removed

netstat (Network statistics)
Command-line tool displays network connections for TCP
Can also display routing tables and network interface/protocol stats
Syntax: -a = connections and listening ports,
	-b = binary executable that made the connection
	-o = owning process id
	-s = per-protocol statistics
	-r = routing table
	-p = for the protocol only eg netstat -p UDP

Layer 6 - The presentation layer
Concerned with transforming data into a format that can be transmitted across a network, but also to convert data from a network into a format the application layer services can process.Done through: Encoding, Declaring media types, Compression

Encoding
Character encoding is used to represent a collection of characters by some kind of encoding algorihtm
A single characater, when encoding is termed a code point
A collection of code points is termed a code space
Code points an dcode spaces may be regarded as bit patterns, octets, natural numbers, electrical pulses, etc which can be used for network transfer
E.g 
ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange, limited set
ISO-8859-1 - Latin alphabet no.1, 191 chars from Latin script
Unicode - A global encoding system containing over 1 Million code points including emoji
Windows-1252 - Used by default in legacy components of Windows

URL encoding
URLS can only be transmitted using the ASCII character-set
URLs often contain character s outside the ASCII format
	So the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format
URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a % followed by two hexadecimals digits
	a space = %20
	ampersand = %26
	equals = %3D


Base64
Base64 is binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation
	Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data
	Three 8-bit bytes (24 bits) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits
Text which does not divide into the 6-bit pattern cleanly is padded using the = sign
Some emial spam filters cannot process multiple iterations of base64 encoded data, which allows the spam messages to reach the destination mailbox

Media types
A media type is standard identifier used on the Internet to indicate the tpye of data that a file contains
Used to be called MIME types
	Multipurpose Internet Mail Exchange
Allows mapping between data and application
Originally used for SMTP
Now used by HTTP and other systems
2 part definitions
	Type/subtype
		Audio/mpeg
		File/txt
		Image/jpg
Registered with IANA


Layer 7 Technologies

HyperText Transfer Protocol
Designed to transfer HTML web pages (now can do many types)

8 methods:
	GET requests a resource
	POST submits data to a resource
	PUT uploads to a resource
	HEAD used to request only the head section of a webpage
Commands sent by client user agent (brwoser)
commands received by web server


HTTP server response scodes
Sent by web server to indicate status of an operation
HTTP server status code categories:
1xx - information
2xx - success
3xx - redirection
4xx - client request error
5xx - server error

HTTP method request headers
HTTP method request headers characaterise requested data
Most headers set by pbrowser - cannot be altered directly
Plug-ins can alter header values
Commonly used headers include
	Host - domain name of required resource
	Used when multiple sites share an IP address
	User-agent - identifies application and OS used to create request
	Can be altered- firefox plug-in
	Accept - acceptable content types
	Cookies - indicates sending of cookie

Response headers
HTTP server response headers characterise data sent by server
commonly used headers include
Server - name of web server
Set-cookie - contains cookie data
Cache-control - how data must be cached
Content-language - language of the data
Content-type - mime type of content
ETag - version identifier of resource


HTTP cookies
HTTP is a stateless protocol
	Web server requires means of identifying users
	A cookie is a text file stored in user's profile on a given host
	Browser checks for presence of a cookie for every HTTP request
	If a cookie is present it will be sent with the HTTP request

Email application software
Protocols:
Store and forward method of sending electronic messages
	Client devices are known as Mail User Agents (MUAs)
	Email servers are known as Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)
Uses a number of protocols for sending and receiving data
	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
	Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3)
	Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
Webmail systems allow a user to access the MTA via HTTP / HTTPS
	Messages delivered via SMTP

SMTP
Uses port 25 by default
Used to deliver mail - known as push protocol
	Used by MUA to deliver to MTA
	Used by MTA to deliver to MTA
Defined in RFC 821
Updated in RFC 5321
	Known as Extendd SMTP (ESMTP)
Headers
Contain information about the message
	when message passes through an MTA it adds line to the header
	Used to track the message through the Internet
	X-headers (Extension headers) are proprietary, non standard information fields which can be used when tracking email delivery faults

POP3
Uses port 110 by default
POP3S (Secure POP3) uses port 995 for encrypted connections using TLS
Used to collect messages - known as a pull protocol
	MUA pulling data from MTA
Defined in RFC 1939
Extensions defined in RFC 2449

IMAP
Uses port 143 by default
	Encrypted connections on port 993
Used to read messages on the MTA
	Downloading of messages optional
	Deleting of messages optional
Multiple user scan access a mailbox simultaneously
Defined in RFC 3501

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
VoIP as a term has evolved to mean any voice communication over an IP network
The International Telecommunications Union defines different kinds of voice transmission over IP networks
	IP Telephony
	Internet Telephony
	VoIP
VoIP uses many different protocols, but the most widely used ones are:
	Session Initiaion Protocol (SIP)
	H.323
	Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
	Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
SIP is used in VoIP networks to set up and tear down calls
	Does not carry voice data
Much of the message syntax and header fields are identical to HTTP
	Request / response headers
Sample headers include:
	REGISTER | Usd by a User Agent to identify its current IP address and the URLs for which it would like to receive calls
	INVITE | Used to establish a media session between User Agents
	ACK | Confirms reliable message exchanges
	CANCEL | Terminates a pending request
	BYE |  Terminates a session between two users in a conference

RTP & RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
RTP is used in most VoIP systems to transfer voice or other data
	Uses UDP as transport layer protocol for streaming data
	No defined port - selects random even port
RTP is used in conjunction with RTCP
RTP provides
	Payload identification
	Sequence numbering
	time stamping
RTCP provides
	Transmission stats
	Quality of Service
	Synchronisation of multiple data streams

Telnet & SSH
Telnet - developed in 1969
	One of the earliest Internet protocols (RFC 15)
Runs over port 23
Provides the suer with a CLI on a remote host
Does not use encryption or authentication
Vulnerable to eavesdropping & hijacking
Most Telnet services now replaced wiht SSH
SSH runs over port 22
	Typically uses encryption


File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Used for file transfer between network hosts
Uses TCP ports 20 and 21
	Control messages user port 21
	Data transferred on port 20
FTP authentication is in clear text
	Many servers allow annonymous FTP
Data transfers uses one of the four data representations: ASCII, Image, EBCDIC, Local
FTP is not natively encrypted
