Network Interfaces
End User Device (EUD) needs a Network Interface Card (NIC)
The NICs have an identifier known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address
(6 pairs of hexadecimal values, also known as physical address)

EUD connects to LAN:
	- Cable from the NIC to a switch
	- Wireless from the NIC to a Wireless Access Point (WAP)
Home devices (routers) often have all these in one package

Switches
	- Read the destination MAC
	- Compares the destination to switch lookup table
	- Forward the frame to the port address
	- Else forward to all
	- For LANs
Routers 
	- Connects two or more networks to create an Internetwork
	- Routers determine the destination networj by processing network address information in the data packet header
	- Routers use network maps (routing tables) to determine the best route to send data
	- Routers forward data packets to the interace which is connected to the determined route (forwarding)
	- Use their own protools for exchanging route availability info: RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP
	- For WANs
Internet : Network of networks
Internet Exchange Point (IXP)

IP address tells you: address where it's from and address 

Personal Area Network (PAN) : Very small area network, 1.5cm - 3m. E.g. USB, Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, etc

Packet switching:
	Data to be delivered is broken into indiviudal packets
		Addressing information in header
	Packets may not follow same path
	Network may be resistant to change and damage

Layered network models

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model: 7 layers
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-link, Physical
A Application specific, P formatting and encryption, S connections between apps, T host-to-host data transfer, N routing and forwarding, D frames data for network, P sends and receives bits on network media 

TCP/IP: 4 layers
Application, Transport, Internet, Link
Example: A HTTP, T TCP, I IP, L Ethernet

Ethernet
Most popular LAN implementation:
	Data transmitted in frames
	Classed as a broadcast technology
Ethernet variants (defined in IEEE standards): 10Base5, 1000BaseT, 1000BaseSX, 10000BaseT

Network Layer Protocols

Accept requests from the Transport layer
Pass requests to the Data Link layer
Responsible for end-to-end data delivery
Responsible for logical addressing of data packets

Internet Protocol (IP)

Protocols that relate to this later include:
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

IP is responsible for end-to-end packet delivery:
	Provides logical addressing
	Non-reliable
	Loss of data
	Data corruption
	Used for routing data across networks
Used to identify a device within a network
	A portion of the address identifies the network
	The remaining portion identifies the host
Addresses are binary patterns
	Written as dotten decimal notation if using IPv4
	Written as hexadecimal notation if using IPv6
32 bit binary address

Subnet mask identifies which part of the IP address is the network part and the host/device part.
1 in mask = network portion of ip address
0 in mask = host portion of ip address


Broadcast address = device id = host id

Private address ranges for IPv4
Used since private networks don't have to be unique

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
The ARP is the standard method for finding a host's hardware address when only its network layer address is known.
It is not IP-only or Ethernet-only; it can be used to resolve many different network-layer protocol addresses to hardware addresses

Network Address Translation (NAT)
Router has two interfaces
	One is assigned a Public IP address (external)
	One is assigned a Private IP address (internal)
Nat translates between internal and external IP addresses
Process:
1. Client sends packet to router
2. Router maps internal IP address (iAddr) and internal port number (iPort) to an external IP address (eAddr) and external port number (ePort) and records these in a NAT table
3. Data is sent across Internet with eAddr & ePort values
4. Destination services respond back to eAddr & ePort
5. Router checks NAT table for values and replaces eAddr & ePort with iAddr & iPort and forwards to specificed device

IPv4 Limitations
Public IP address exhaustion
	IANA handed out the last IPv4 pools to RIR in Feb 2011
	ARIN handed out last block in Sept 2015
The original method of allocating addresses was inefficient
	Methods were introduced to prolong the life of IPV4
		CIDR & Route aggregation
		NAT (broke end to end connectivity)
IPv6 will be the long term solution

IPv6 originally defined in RFC 1773, then RFC 2460, now RFC 8200
128-bit addresses written in eight gorups of four hexadecimal digits
Each group represents 16 bits

Leading zeroes may be omitted: 0db8:0000:0000:0070 -> db8:0:0:70
A single group of consecutive zeroes can be replaced with a double colon:
85a3:0000:0000:8a2e -> 85a3::8a2e
You can only have one double colon

Types of IPv6 address
Global unicast (2000::/3) for Internet communications
Link-local (fe80) for communications within the same LAN/Segment/Subnet
Unique local (fc00) similar to private IP addresses
IPv6 does not use a broadcast address instead it uses multicast groups: ff00::/8

Allocating IPv6 addresses
IPv6 addresses can be allocated statically or dynamically
	StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) is one way of allocating
	SLAAC does nto need any server or relay because there is no state to maintain (RFC 2462)
Routers within a network advertise their IPv6 network prefix that identifies the subnet(s)
Hosts generate an interface identifier (the host portion) that uniquely identifeis an interface on a subnet
	Can use MAC address (EUI-64)
	Can be randomly generated (RFC 4941)
An address is formed by combining the two: Network prefix + interface identifier

Routers
Have multiple network interfaces
	Move IP datagrams from one interface to another
consult a routing table to make decisions
Two-part process
	Routing: Deciding the correct path to the destination
	Forwarding: Moving packets to the correct interface
May perform other functions
	Network Address Translation (NAT)
	Firewall

A routing table stores entries which are use for datagram forwarding:
Routing table entries consist of the following:
	Network ID
	Next hop
	May contain Metrics
	Routing protocols allow routers to create routing tables

Dynamic routing protocols
Routers advertise networks they know about
	Allows routers to build a map of the network
Three main classes of routing protocol: Distance vector, link-state, hybrid
Interior and Exterior Gateway Protocols

Distance vector routing (not really a good protocol):
Distance is the cost of reachign a destination, usually based onthe number of hosts the path pases through, or the total of all the administrative metrics assigned to the links in the path
Vector is the interface that traffic will be forwarded outr in order to reach a given destination.

Link-State routing:
Protocols:
- Require each router to maintain at least a partial map of the network
- Know whetehr a link is up or down, how fast it is and calculate an overall cost to get there
	- When a network link chagnes state (up to down, or vice versa), a notification, called a link state advertisement (LSA) is flooded throughout the network
		All routers note the change, and recompute their routes accordingly
- Will take a path which ahs more hops, but uses a faster medium instead of a path using a slower medium with fewer hops


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
DHCP provides automatic configuration of IP addressing
	Requires a DHCP serever
	Manages IP addresses and mask allocation from a pool of addresses
		Other configuration options availabile (DNS, addresses, DGW address, WINS addresses)
Client
	Configured to use dynamic addressing
	Leased the configuration for given period of time

Client-side DHCP
DHCP configues other aspects of IP addressing:
	Default Gateway address
	DNS Server addresses
	WINS server address
	To view IP information type ipconfig /all
	Configuration is leased for a given period
		Renewed at 50% of lease period
		IP configuration can be released
		IP address placed back into usable pool
DHCP function - IPv6
DHCP and DHCPv6 are known as stateful protocols because they maintain tables within dedicated servers.
DHCPv6 uses UDP ports
	Servers listen on UDP port 547
	Clients listen on UDP port 546
Messages
	DORA - replaced with new messages (SARR)
	SOLICIT (1), ADVERTISE (2), REQUEST (3), REPLY (7)

Internet control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Defined in RFC 792
Used for control and information messages
Reporting errors and diagnostic purposes
Multiple message types available
Header contains:
	Type: define type of packet
	Code: further specifies the ICMP type
	Checksum: Used to error-check the ICMP header and data
	The rest: varying data dependant on code and type

Ping tests network connectivity, 4 packets
Traceroute displays routers used to a given destination, 3 packets

DNS resolution = DNS name -> IP address
Two types of DNS query: 

DNS forward lookup - Known DNS name, unknown IP address
[A] records resolve a name to an IP address

DNS reverse lookup - Known IP address, unknwon DNS name
[AAAA] records

DNS Root servers
	Store copies of the root zone database
	Maps Top Level Level Domain names (TLDs) to authoritative DNS servers
	13 named Root server authorities
	More than 13 physical servers - accessed by anycast
	Root Server address cached by DNS servers

Caching DNS servers
Most basic type of DNS server
	Contains no authoritative zone databases
	Performs recursive queries on behalf of clinets
	Queries global DNS during recursive query
Requires IP addresses of Root Servers
	Root Hints file
Answer to query is
	Cached on the server
	Passed to the client

Authoritative DNS servers
Host DNS zone databses
Can make authoritative answers to DNS queries
Zone database has a specific structure
Used by both Windows servers and Unix servers

Domain Names
A domain name is a text string that can be mapped to an IP address
domain names form the basis of the DNS
	DNS is used to obtain the IP address of a device from its given domain name
Internet Domains Names must be registered
	Registration can be via a domain registrar
Domain Names must be unique on the Internet
domain Name Records are stored in zone files on name servers

The Hosts file
Text file containing hostname to IP address mappings
	Contents loaded inot the DNS cache at system startup or if changes to the file are made
Windows C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc
Default entry is the loopback address
Can be used as a security measure, but can also be poisoned

DNS cache contains previous lookups
Entries re-used to reduce load on DNS servers
	Caches positive and negative responses
	Cached data is timed out
		Entries specifiy their own TTL
Use ipconfig /displaydns to show cache contents
ipconfig /flushdns to empty cache


Layer 4 and 5 technologies

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Provides end-to-end data transfer between applications
	Uses port numbers
	No flow control
	No connection setup
	No lost data retransmission
Useful in some situations
	Single data packets
	Voice over IP (VOIP)
Defined in RFC 768

UDP header structure
Source port
	Identifies sending port using 16 bits - optional
Destination port
	Identiies destination port using 16 bits - mandatory
Length
	Length of entire datagram in bytes - mandatory
Checksum
	16 bit checksum error-checking header and data - mandatory

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
Provides end-to-end data transfer between applications
Uses port numbers
TCP has flow control
	Arranges data into byte stream
Connection-oriented
Acknowledges data receipt
Used if sending multiple packets e.g web pages or .mp3 files
Defined in RFC 793

TCP header structure
Complex header
Includes: source/destination port, sequence number, acknowledgement number, offset, res, checksum, flag, window, urgent pointer, options
32 bit options fields can be used if needed
16 bit source/destination ports identify endpoints of the TCP connection


3-Way handshake
Begins every TCP conversation
SYN packet:
	Has the SYN flag set, contains sender's Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
SYN/ACK packet:
	Has SYN & ACK flags set
	Contains receivers ISN
	Acknowledgement number = sender's ISN + 1
ACK packet
	Has ACK flag set
	Sequence number = ISN + 1
	Acknowledgement number = receiver's ISN + 1k

Ports and sockets
A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on a network
A socket is bound to a port number so that TCP/UDP can identify the program that data is destined for
A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number -e.g 87.16.4.96:63584
Every TCP or UDP session can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints
Multiple sessions can be established between host and server

Ports and port numbers
There are 2^16 TCP & 2^16 UDP ports
	Port numbers can be registered wiht IANA
Ports 0 to 1023 - System ports / well-known range
Ports 1024 to 49151 - User ports
Ports 49152 to 65535 - Dynamic ports

Example ports and services
Web browsing protocols and corresponding port numbers
HTTP uses port 80 on the web server b default
	Data sent via HTTP is not encrypted
HTTPS uses port 443 on the web servers by default
	Data sent by HTTPS is encrypted

An email protocol and corresponding port number
POP3 uses port 110 on the email server by default, not encrypted
POP3S usese port 995 on the emial server by default, encrypted

Services: web server, email server
Ports: 80, 110
Internet Protocol: IP Address
Network card: Data arrives and leaves device
